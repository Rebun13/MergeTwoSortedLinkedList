# MergeTwoSortedLinkedList

## Description

Given pointers to the heads of two sorted linked lists, merge them into a single, sorted linked list. Either head pointer may be null meaning that the corresponding list is empty.

## Returns

- SinglyLinkedListNode pointer: a reference to the head of the merged list

## Input Format

- The first line contains an integer_t_, the number of test cases.

The format for each test case is as follows:

- The first line contains an integer _n_,  the length of the first linked list.
- The next _n_lines contain an integer each, the elements of the linked list.
- The next line contains an integer _m_, the length of the second linked list.
- The next _m_ lines contain an integer each, the elements of the second linked list.
